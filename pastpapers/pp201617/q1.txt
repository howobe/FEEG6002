a)  A version control system is a system that allows a programmer to track changes to a script or program being written and switch between logged versions of said program, without having to explicitly create new copies using "Save as".

A version control system is software for managing changes to programs and other documents. There a several different vcs systems including git and mercurial.


b)  1. It creates a timeline of events and changes that allow incremental improvements and changes to be created often.

    2. It enables programmers to collaborate on a project.

    3. With features like branching, programmers can work on experimental features whilst not putting the public main (master) branch and its users (consumers) at risk.

    1. Clean way to back up your programs (especially if pushing to remote copy of repository): commit changes happen incrementally and you can return to a previous version at anytime.

    2. Allows user to work from multiple different machines.

    3. Allows users to collaborate without overwriting existing changes.

c)  1. git init - create a repositry in the current directory; creates hidden subfolder with config info
    2. git clone <remote> - create a copy of a remote repository on your local machine
    3. git diff <branch_a> <branch_b> - display the differences of two branches
    4. git add <file> - stage a file
    5. git commit <file> -m <msg> - commit a file, attaching a commit message.
