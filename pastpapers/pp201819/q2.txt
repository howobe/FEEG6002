a)	- print_msg should not return 0 since its defined as returning void
	- No argument should be passed to print_msg as its defined as receiving void.
	
b)	- No quotation marks around the printf statement
	printf("...");
	- scanf should be passed an address i.e &answer
	- The format specifier is for a float; it should be %d

c)	- A struct name is not defined
	i.e. struct info {
	...};
	- A struct cannot be intialized in this way
	should be struct info boy = {"Leo", 8};

d)	

e)	- *p is declared as a pointer to void
	i.e should be float *p;

f)	- Firstly this a union should not be intialised like this; should be
	
	union data{
		...
		} generic_variable;
	
	generic_variable.a_word = "WOW";
	generic_variable.a_word = 1000;
	
	- However one cannot initialise both at once, the purpose of a union is that it stores
	as much memory as the largest member, and can only store one at a time. Good for a variable
	that may change type.
