a) printf should use the format code %c instead as 'c' is a character, not a string.
b) There should only be one % before the formatting specifier.
c) To do this the escape character should be invoked
	i.e. printf("\"hello\n\"");
d) There are missing quotes around the string.
e) The character specifier is used, however a string is given.
	either printf("%c", 'x');
	or printf("%s", "x");
