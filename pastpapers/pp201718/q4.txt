a)  - colon instead of semicolon
    - value comparison should be done with == not =
    - semicolon after if statement is not correct
    - else not otherwise

b)  - loop limits do not represent the memory allocated at the declaration point; ideally (for optimal readability)

    for (x=0; x<10; x++)
    {
        for (y=0; y<3; y++)
        {
            array[x][y] = 0;
        }
    }

    - whilst indentation is not essential in c, ideally return 0; would be indented

c)  - *string2
    - memory needs to allocated to string2, equalling the size of string1 
    string2 = (char *) malloc(sizeof(char)*(strlen(string1)+1));
